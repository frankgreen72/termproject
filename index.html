          <p>
            From a history of urban renewal and relentless land pressure, Chinatown today is ever-so a site of contention. Indeed, if Chinatown now functions as an incomplete community, it is largely due to its extensive history of planning insensitivity and development leniency, which allowed the incremental suppression of essential services and amenities - notably carved out of the urban fabric through several large redevelopment projects (e.g., Complexe Guy-Favreau). This has led to the demolition of many housing blocks, local businesses, groceries, parks, and religious buildings - never to be replaced.
            <br><br>
            As such, land pressure in the area has reached its pinnacle, hemming the local community to the point of suffocation. In an environment where every parcel of land is fiercely contested, planning for the provision of services is of critical importance.

          <p>
            For this project, the study area is Montrealâ€™s Chinatown, a personal area of interest of mine as it has now been the subject of multiple projects in my university journey and beyond. In that sense, my work realized as part of the Resilient Space Project (RSP) in URBS 433 has nurtured a strong sense of attachment with the area and its community. As such, the work of the RSP acts as the basis and contextual foundation for this assignment and is introduced under the RSP tab.
